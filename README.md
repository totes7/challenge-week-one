# Challenge Week 1

## Horiseon SEO Website

The objective of this project was to refactor a starter code for this website in order to improve accessibility and overall readability of the code.

This was achieved by the following steps:

* Description and keywords meta tags were added.
* In the HTML file, non-semantic div tag were replaced by semantic tags such as header, figure, main, aside, section and footer.
* Alt attributes were added to all images and icons.
* CSS file was modified to remove redundant selectors and classes.
* Comments were added throughout the code, in both HTML and CSS files.
